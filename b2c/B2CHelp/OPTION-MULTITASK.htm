<B><P>Description :</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>OPTION MULTITASK OFF is mainly for the HELP key. When the HELP key is pressed it spawns a new thread which displays the help info.  Normally the video game or app continues to run in MULTITASKING MODE.  This is bad because it can erase the help screen and / or cause the player to lose "lives" or "health points" etc... because the game is continuing on and the player cannot see it.</P>

<P>Specifying OPTION MULTITASK OFF means that when the HELP screen is displayed, the game pauses.  Now this may not be desired.  For example a CHAT application could drop messages.  So, MULTITASKING is a compile-time option.</P></DIR>
