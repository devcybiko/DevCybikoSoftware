</B><P>The Score command has two modes.  If no parameter is supplied, it will show the top 5 scores for the game in the current font and the current ink and paper colors.  If a high_score is supplied, then the high_score is compared to existing high scores in the score.inf file and will replace one of them with the new high_score (if the high_score is higher). </P>

<P>Note: You must include a score.inf file (supplied) in your .list file.</P></DIR>
