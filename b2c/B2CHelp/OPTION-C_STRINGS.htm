<B><P>Description :</P>
<P>&#9;</B>The C compiler offers a powerful string formatting capability.  Characters placed in a literal string can be preceded by the backslash character (\) also known as the escape character.  Using this escape character special characters (like \n for newline and \003 for ^C) could be inserted into the middle of a string.  </P>
<P>However Cybasic does not offer this capability.  To solve this delemma, the OPTION C_STRINGS command was introduced.  If OPTION C_STRINGS appears at the top of a program, the escape character is interpretted as a C string.  However if OPTION CYBASIC_STRINGS appears at the top of a program, the escape character has no special meaning.  The default is OPTION CYBASIC_STRINGS.</P>
<B><P>Example :</P>
<P>&#9;</B>OPTION C_STRINGS</P>
<P>&#9;Print "\"Hello World\""</P>
<B><P>Results:</P>
<P>&#9;"Hello World"</P>
