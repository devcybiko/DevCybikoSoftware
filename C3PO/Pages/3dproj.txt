!3d Projection

Simply, to turn a set of 3d points (x,y,z) to a 2d point (x,y) you scale
by the z value. The center point of the screen is 80,50 and your 2d points
are relative to this.

If the z value of a point is negative is is further away so you reduce the
value of the x,y (e.g. 100,100 to 50,50).

If the z value is positive (closer )you increase the value of x and y accordingly.

The attached example demostrates the above.
