Inside, among the<br>replacement parts I required, there was nestled a black plastic<br>parallelogram of a box, with a USB cable snaking out of the back, and<br>the familiar "@Cybiko" on the cover. What a score!  I got out my<br>screwdriver, plugged it in, installed the CyWIG software, and got to<br>work. Let's see what I've found :) <br><br><br><center><img src="attach?page=InsideCyWig/wotis2.jpeg"></center><br><br><br><P>First the case, as seen above. It has a short, greyish antenna<br>sticking out of it, which like the classic, can be moved forward and<br>back.  The top front has an LED that indicates power and activity, and i<br>found a tiny hole on the side that i later discovered to be situated<br>over a reset button.  The bottom of the unit has the four tiny screws<br>for the cover, a slot for wall mounting with a screw, and a square<br>impression, where they were obviously intending on engraving serial #<br>info.  This particular unit has a piece of paper taped across the bottom<br>that says "D-047  AAL9UCB".  The CyWIG itself has a serial number, just<br>like any Cybiko wireless.<br><P>The next step, of course, was installing the CyWIG software, plugging<br>it in, and seeing what was what.  Anyone who has used the Virtual CyWIG<br>would notice the manager for the actual CyWIG is identical.  The only<br>real difference I have found is that there are no xtreme icons that<br>display.  When an Xtreme comes into the area, it appears on the CyWIG<br>AM monitor with a Classic icon.<br><P>The next notable thing is that the software shuts down after a few<br>moments, due to the fact that mail1.cybiko.com is no longer replying,<br>Cybiko having taken it offline.  It then displays this rather<br>interesting message:<br><br><Br><center><img src = "attach?page=InsideCyWig/wigerr.jpeg"></center><br><br><br>It also occasionally displays this dialog, which I have yet to determine<br>what it does, if anything:<br><br><br><center><img src = "attach?page=InsideCyWig/huh.jpeg"></center><br><br><br><br><hr><br><p> Overall, this is NOT an Xtreme.  It's a Classic with a USB cable<br>soldered to it, and has a hard connector that attaches to the antenna<br>inside. It was difficult, but I was able to twist it just enough to take<br>a picture of the actual circuit board.<br><br><br><center><img src="attach?page=InsideCyWig/inside1.jpeg"> <img src="attach?page=InsideCyWig/inside2.jpeg"></center><br><br><br><p>Because it's a bit hard to see, i went through and cataloged the<br>chips inside, with part numbers. Not exactly like the Classics, but certainly comparable.<br><br><br><br><br><center><br><li>Processor: <a href = "attach?page=InsideCyWig/atmel.pdf">Atmel AT90S4433</a><br><li>CoProcessor: <a href = "attach?page=InsideCyWig/atmel2.pdf">Atmel AT89C51</a><br><LI>Latches Processor: Texas Instruments ALS373A<br><P>  From TI's Site: "These octal transparent D-type latches feature 3-state<br>outputs designed specifically for driving highly capacitive or relatively low-impedance loads. They are particularly suitable for implementing buffer registers, I/O ports, bidirectional bus drivers, and working registers."<br><p>***Note: It's highly possible that this chip acts as a buffer for the<br>RF section of the board, as it is located between the processor and the<br>RF Mosfets.<br><br><br><br><li>SRAM: <a href = "attach?page=InsideCyWig/U6264ASA.pdf">ZMD U6264ASA</a><br><li>usb controller: <a href = "attach?page=InsideCyWig/USBN9603.pdf">NSC USBN9603-<br>28M</a><br></center><br><br><br><br><P> Interesting, Isn't it? If iI can devise a workaround with the<br>server, I'll post it. Apparently, that roblem is effecting virtual<br>CyWIGs as well.<br><br>I'll also keep the community updated on any new findings I make.<br><br><br>Cheers<br><Br>Trevor / KlugeRoom</td>
